        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why Convert PNG to JPG?</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and JPG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) are both popular
            image formats, each with unique advantages. JPG images are generally smaller in size and widely supported,
            making them ideal for web use and sharing. Converting your PNG images to JPG can help reduce file size
            without significantly compromising quality. JPG files are commonly used for photographs and images on the
            web because of their excellent compression capabilities, which make them load faster on web pages and reduce
            storage requirements.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Additionally, some applications and platforms may only support JPG format, making it necessary
            to convert PNG images to ensure compatibility. By converting PNG to JPG, you can also ensure that your
            images maintain high visual quality while being optimized for different uses, including social media
            sharing, email attachments, and online galleries.</p>
